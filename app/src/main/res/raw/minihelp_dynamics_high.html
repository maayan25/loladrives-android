<h2>SEGMENT – Dynamics High</h2>

<p>In order to exclude driving that could be regarded as <b>too aggressive</b>, the high dynamic boundary condition
 sets an upper limit for the acceleration behavior.</p>
<p>It is checked whether the 95th percentile of the product of acceleration and speed is below a limit set by the EU.</p>
<p>This limit depends on the average speed of the corresponding segment. </p>
<p>In this drive and segment, the upper limit is <b>LIMIT m²/s³</b> </p>
