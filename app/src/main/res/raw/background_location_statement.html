<h2>Adjust Location Permissions</h2>
<p> It seems like your Android system did not grant us the permissions we need. We explicitly must be able to access your
location also when <b>LolaDrives</b> is in the <b>background or the display turns off</b>. Gaps in the data stream prevent us from
 validating your RDE test. Your location is accessed only during active RDE test sessions.</p>
  <p>Please follow the instructions in the next Android system dialogue to enable location access all the time.</p>
