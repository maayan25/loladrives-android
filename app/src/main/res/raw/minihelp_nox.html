<h2>NO<sub>x</sub> Emissions</h2>

<p>The NO<sub>x</sub> emissions value indicates how much nitrogen oxides the tested vehicle emitted per kilometer
 during the RDE drive.</p>
<p>These values differ depending on the <b>year of type approval</b> and the <b>year of first admission</b> of the vehicle.</p>

 between September 2019 and December 2020, must emit at most <b>168 mg/km</b> of nitric oxides.
 Diesel cars approved or admitted later, must conform to a <b>120 mg/km</b> threshold.
