<h2>SEGMENT – Dynamics Low</h2>

<p>In order to exclude driving that could be regarded as <b>too smooth</b>, the low dynamic boundary condition sets a lower limit for the <b>relative positive acceleration (RPA)</b>.</p>
<p>It is checked whether the ratio of the distance accelerated to the total distance of a segment exceeds a limit set by the EU.</p>
<p>This limit depends on the average speed of the corresponding segment. </p>
<p>In this drive and segment, the lower limit is <b>LIMIT m/s²</b> </p>
