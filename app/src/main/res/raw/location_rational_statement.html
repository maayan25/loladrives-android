  <p>In order to validate RDE tests, LolaDrives must be able to access location data from your mobile
   device at any time during a test. You denied this access, so LolaDrives cannot be used for RDE tests.</p>
  <p>Please allow location access (at any time) for LolaDrives in your Android system preferences to conduct RDE tests.
   Your location is accessed only during active RDE test sessions.
